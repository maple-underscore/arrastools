What do you mean thats a perfectly acceptable way to type who needs punctuation to clarify or break up a paragraph to make it more readable and actually legible when you can just type a bunch of rambling words into one massive incoherent thought that never seems to end and makes to really difficult to glean the actual point from scanning the paragraph which is what most people do but instead force you to read every single word in order and of course the order is all crazy and so you have to actively dumb yourself down to my level to figure out what the fuck im talking about and then realize that it probably could have been summed up in one sentence with actual punctuation so you get very annoyed at the person writing it for making you read this nonsense but you finish it anyways because you already read halfway through and goddamnit you're determined to just make it all the way through and see if maybe there's more substance to that massive brick wall of text but when you get to the end and there wasn't any at all its like a big fuck you from the writer for not communicating more efficiently 📖📕📚
