THE BIG PLAN FOR HOW OUR LAND IS RUN (SAID IN SIMPLE WORDS)
Preamble (why we made this plan)

We, the people who live on this land made of many states, agree to a plan so we can live in peace, help each other, keep safe, be fair, and stay free—now and for our children.
Part One — The two big rooms that make common orders

    The people’s work of making common orders is done by two big rooms.

    First room (house one): People from many small areas are picked every two years. More people in an area means more seats.

    Second room (house two): Each state sends the same number of people for longer time.

    These rooms write common orders, set how we use money, and can raise and lead groups to keep us safe.

    A paper with money for the year must start in house one.

    The two rooms can call the head and other people in to answer hard questions, and can make their own inside rules.

    They can kick people from jobs who do very bad things. One room charges, the other tries.

Part Two — The head who leads the work each day

    A head runs the day-to-day work. People in each state pick people who then pick the head.

    The head leads the fight group, can make deals with other lands (needs “okay” from house two), picks high job people and other important people (also needs “okay” from house two), and makes sure common orders are carried out.

    If the head does very bad things, the two rooms can remove the head from the job.

Part Three — How we decide fights about common orders

    There are places that decide fights about this plan and about common orders.

    The top place can look at hard fights from lower places.

    These places also judge fights between states, and fights that cross state lines.

    People who help the other side in a fight against our land can be tried in the top place.

Part Four — How states work with each other

    Each state should respect other states’ papers and acts.

    People who break rules and run to another state can be brought back.

    New states can join. The big plan keeps each state safe.

Part Five — How we change the plan

    We can change this plan.

    A change can be proposed by a very large share of the two rooms, or by a meeting called by many states.

    A change becomes real when many states agree (a very large share of them).

    No state loses its equal say in house two without saying yes.

Part Six — The top plan

    This plan and the common orders made under it are the top plan over all states.

    People who work under this plan must promise to follow it.

    No one has to say they follow any god to get a job under this plan.

Part Seven — How the plan began

    Once enough states agreed, the plan began to work.

THE CHANGES (27) — SAID IN SIMPLE WORDS
The first ten changes (the list of rights)

    You can talk, write, meet, and ask the people in charge to fix things; you can follow your own way about God.

    You may keep and carry guns.

    In quiet times, no one can force fight people to live in your house.

    Police can’t search you, your house, or your things, or take them, unless they have a good reason and a paper that says they can.

    You can’t be put on the same bad-act case two times, can’t be made to say things that hurt yourself, and the plan must use the right steps before it can take your life, freedom, or things.

    If the land says you did a bad act, you get a fast, open hearing near where it happened; you get to know what you’re charged with, to see and ask people who speak against you, to bring people to speak for you, and to have help.

    In money fights between people, you can have a group of people help decide.

    No pay to get out that is too high, and no hurt that is too much.

    You have more rights than only the ones written here.

    Power not given to the big plan is kept by the states or the people.

Other changes

11. Limits some fights against a state in the top place that decides fights.

12. Changes how we pick the head and the helper so the choice is clearer.

13. No one can own another person.

14. If you are born here, you are one of us. States and the big plan must use the same steps and give the same help to all people.

15. No one can be stopped from picking leaders because of skin or because they were once kept by others.

16. The big plan may take pay from what you make to run the land.

17. People in each state pick the second house directly.

18. A drink ban on making, moving, and selling strong drink.

19. Women can pick leaders, same as men.

20. Moves the start and end times for top jobs and for the two rooms, and deals with what happens if the pick is not done in time.

21. Ends the drink ban in change 18.

22. The head can only have two times in that job.

23. People who live in the main city get to help pick the head.

24. You don’t have to pay to be able to pick leaders.

25. If the head dies, leaves, or can’t do the job, the helper acts as head; sets steps for saying when the head can’t do the job and how the head can come back.

26. People who are at least 18 can pick leaders.

27. If the two rooms raise their own pay, it starts after the next pick time, not right away.
Last words

This is the same plan, just told with simple words: two big rooms make common orders, a head runs day-to-day work, places that decide fights keep the plan in line, states help each other, we can change the plan, the plan sits on top, and the people keep many strong rights.
