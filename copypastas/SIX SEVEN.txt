Once upon a time, in a world where numbers had consciousness and personalities, Six and Seven were the most unlikely of companions. They had been close friends since they were mere digits scribbled on the pages of a dusty old book, but over the years, a dark secret had festered between them like a malignant tumor. Years ago, during a camping trip under the cloak of the wilderness, Seven had brought along three sharpened knives. He had claimed they were for survival, for cutting ropes or hunting small game, but Six had always known better. The glint in Seven's eye, the subtle clench of his fist around the hilt of the knives, spoke volumes of the hatred that boiled beneath his surface.

Six had lived in constant fear of Seven's true intentions, the memory of that trip haunting his every waking moment. He could still feel the cold steel of the blade that Seven had placed against his throat, the harsh whisper of "you're just a worthless number," ringing in his ears. But fear had made Six strong, had honed his instincts to a razor's edge. He had prepared for this day, the day when Seven would finally snap.

And snap he did.

In a sudden fit of rage, Seven lunged at Six, the knives flashing in the moonlight like the teeth of a ravenous beast. But Six was ready. He had been waiting for this moment, had been training in the shadows for this very confrontation. With a roar that echoed through the desolate landscape, Six met Seven's charge head-on.

The first knife sliced through the air, aiming for Six's heart, but he was too quick. He sidestepped the blow, the wind of the blade's passing sending shivers down his spine. With a swift counter, Six slammed his fist into Seven's face, the sound of bone crunching like a walnut under a hammer. Blood spurted from Seven's nose, painting a crimson streak across his cheek.

The second knife was met with a brutal elbow to the gut, causing Seven to double over in pain. Six could feel the bile rising in his throat as he grabbed the wrist holding the weapon and twisted it with a vicious snarl. The bone popped like a dry twig, and Seven's scream pierced the silence of the night. The knife clattered to the ground, forgotten in the frenzy of the fight.

The third knife was a blur as Seven thrust it upwards, aiming for Six's belly. But Six was not about to be a victim. He caught Seven's wrist with one hand and brought his knee up into the soft flesh with a sickening crunch. The knife fell again, and Six wrenched it free, holding it tightly in his trembling grip.

Seven stumbled back, his eyes wide with shock and pain. He had never seen Six like this before, never knew the depth of the fear and anger he had bottled up inside. But now, it was too late for apologies or explanations.

Six advanced, the knife gleaming with the promise of retribution. He could feel the adrenaline coursing through his veins, the power of his rage making him feel invincible. "You always talked about survival," he spat, "but you never knew what it was really like to be afraid, did you?"

Seven's eyes darted back and forth, looking for an escape that wasn't there. "Please," he gasped, his voice a broken whisper of the number he used to be. "I didn't mean it."

But Six was beyond mercy. With a feral growl, he plunged the knife into Seven's chest, the blade sinking deep into the soft flesh with an ease that sent a chill down his spine. Seven's eyes rolled back in his head, and he collapsed to the ground, a lifeless heap.

Six stood over the body, his chest heaving with the exertion of the fight. He looked down at the blood-soaked knife, then at Seven's corpse. The years of fear had culminated in this moment of brutal clarity. He had killed his friend, his tormentor, and he felt nothing but a strange sense of relief.

The wind picked up, rustling through the leaves and carrying with it the distant howl of a lone wolf. Six dropped the knife and turned away, leaving the lifeless body of Seven behind. He knew that he would never be the same again, that he had crossed a line from which there was no returning.

But as he disappeared into the night, the darkness seemed to swallow his guilt, leaving only the cold, hard reality of survival. And in that moment, Six knew that he had become something more than just a number. He had become a force to be reckoned with, a symbol of the primal instinct that lived within us all.
