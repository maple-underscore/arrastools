The preference for the expression "gg" instead of "ᴇz" in video game interactions can be explained by its straightforwardness and sense of propriety. The term "gg," which is formed by repeating a single character, requires minimal physical effort, as it allows players to avoid moving their fingers across various keys. This ease of use stands in contrast to "ᴇz," which necessitates a more complex keystroke arrangement. Additionally, "gg," an abbreviation for "good game," embodies a spirit of sportsmanship and mutual respect, contributing to a positive community environment. In contrast, "ᴇz," often perceived as dismissive and self-satisfied, introduces an unwarranted tone of condescension that detracts from the collaborative nature of competition.
